# Dotfiles

## How to install?

### Home Manager

Install Nix by running following the steps on the [NixOS website](https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-install-macos). 
Then install nix-darwin by following the instructions on its [Github page](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin#install).

### ZSH
Follow the installation instructions in the [zinit Github Page](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit#install) to install zinit.
The rest of zsh configuration should take care of itself.

#### zshrc-custom
This file is used to add lines to zshrc that do not need to be versioned. Create and symlink it by running:
```
touch [path to dotfiles]/.zshrc-custom.zsh && ln -s [path to dotfiles]/.zshrc-custom.zsh ~/.zshrc-custom.zsh
```

### Karabiner
The Karabiner configuration is generated by a tool called [Goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo), since the DSL it provides is much more friendly than the JSON used by Karabiner. To generate the configuration, and symlink it, run the following:

Make sure to remove the folder `~/.config/karabiner` before proceeding.

```shell
$ rm -r ~/.config/karabiner # delete the old karabiner configuration
$ ln -s [path to dotfiles]/misc/karabiner/ ~/.config/karabiner
$ brew install yqrashawn/goku/goku
$ goku -c ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.edn
```

### cVim
Install cVim from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cvim/ihlenndgcmojhcghmfjfneahoeklbjjh).

Update `configpath` to reflect the location of `.cvimrc` file (in dotfiles
folder). Then load it on the browser by running `:source {$pathToCvimRC}`.

### Visual Studio Code
Install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Find the setting file location from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-file-locations)

Symlink settings.json by running
```
ln -s [path to dotfiles]/vscode/{settings.json,keybindings.json} [path to vscode settings.json]
```

### BetterTouchTool3

Import the config in `misc/BetterTouchTool` by pressing preset then import.

### Tmux

```
